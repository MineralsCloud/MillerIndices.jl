It has access to newer features, and is likely faster.\nThe long-term support release is an older version of Julia that has continued to receive bug and security fixes. However, it may not have the latest features or performance improvements.\n\nFor most users, you should install the current stable release, and whenever Julia releases a new version of the current stable release, you should update your version of Julia. Note that any code you write on one version of the current stable release will continue to work on all subsequent releases.\n\nFor users in restricted software environments (e.g., your enterprise IT controls what software you can install), you may be better off installing the long-term support release because you will not have to update Julia as frequently.\n\nVersions above v1.3, especially the latest stable ones, are strongly recommended. This package is highly unlikely to work on v1.0 and earlier versions.

One is that it assumes A uses one-based indexing, which would fail in cases like OffsetArrays.jl and FFTViews.jl. Another issue is that it requires indexing, while not all array types support indexing (for example, CuArrays.jl). A more generic compatible implementation of this function would be to use broadcast, for example:\n\nfunction f(A, B)\n    @. A = A + B\nend\n\nwhich would allow support for a wider variety of array types.","category":"section"},{"location":"developers/design-principles/#Internal-types-should-match-the-types-used-by-users-when-possible","page":"Design Principles","title":"Internal types should match the types used by users when possible","text":"If f(A) takes the input of some collections and computes an output from those collections, then it should be expected that if the user gives A as an Array, the computation should be done via Arrays. If A was a CuArray, then it should be expected that the computation should be internally done using a CuArray (or appropriately error if not supported). For these reasons, constructing arrays via generic methods, like similar(A), is preferred when writing f instead of using non-generic constructors like Array(undef,size(A)) unless the function is documented as being non-generic.","category":"section"},{"location":"developers/design-principles/#Trait-definition-and-adherence-to-generic-interface-is-preferred-when-possible","page":"Design Principles","title":"Trait definition and adherence to generic interface is preferred when possible","text":"Julia provides many interfaces, for example:\n\nIteration\nIndexing\nBroadcasting\n\nThose interfaces should be followed when possible. For example, when defining broadcast overloads, one should implement a BroadcastStyle as suggested by the documentation instead of simply attempting to bypass the broadcast system via copyto! overloads.\n\nWhen interface functions are missing, these should be added to an interface package, like ArrayInterface.jl. Such traits should be declared and used when appropriate. For example, if a line of code requires mutation, the trait ArrayInterface.ismutable(A) should be checked before attempting to mutate, and informative error messages should be written to capture the immutable case (or, an alternative code which does not mutate should be given).\n\nOne example of this principle is demonstrated in the generation of Jacobian matrices. In many scientific applications, one may wish to generate a Jacobian cache from the user's input u0. A naive way to generate this Jacobian is J = similar(u0,length(u0),length(u0)). However, this will generate a Jacobian J such that J isa Matrix.","category":"section"},{"location":"developers/design-principles/#Macros-should-be-limited-and-only-be-used-for-syntactic-sugar","page":"Design Principles","title":"Macros should be limited and only be used for syntactic sugar","text":"Macros define new syntax, and for this reason they tend to be less composable than other coding styles and require prior familiarity to be easily understood. One principle to keep in mind is, \"can the person reading the code easily picture what code is being generated?\". For example, a user of Soss.jl may not know what code is being generated by:\n\n@model (x, α) begin\n    σ ~ Exponential()\n    β ~ Normal()\n    y ~ For(x) do xj\n        Normal(α + β * xj, σ)\n    end\n    return y\nend\n\nand thus using such a macro as the interface is not preferred when possible. However, a macro like @muladd is trivial to picture on a code (it recursively transforms a*b + c to muladd(a,b,c) for more accuracy and efficiency), so using such a macro for example:\n\njulia> @macroexpand(@muladd k3 = f(t + c3 * dt, @. uprev + dt * (a031 * k1 + a032 * k2)))\n:(k3 = f((muladd)(c3, dt, t), (muladd).(dt, (muladd).(a032, k2, (*).(a031, k1)), uprev)))\n\nis recommended. Some macros in this category are:\n\n@inbounds\n@muladd\n@view\n@named\n@.\n@..\n\nSome performance macros, like @simd, @threads, or @turbo from LoopVectorization.jl, make an exception in that their generated code may be foreign to many users. However, they still are classified as appropriate uses as they are syntactic sugar since they do (or should) not change the behavior of the program in measurable ways other than performance.","category":"section"},{"location":"developers/design-principles/#Errors-should-be-caught-as-early-as-possible,-and-error-messages-should-be-made-contextually-clear-for-newcomers","page":"Design Principles","title":"Errors should be caught as early as possible, and error messages should be made contextually clear for newcomers","text":"Whenever possible, defensive programming should be used to check for potential errors before they are encountered deeper within a package.

An example of this is seen in Optimization.jl which has subpackages like OptimizationBBO.jl for BlackBoxOptim.jl support.\n\nSome important interface packages to be aware of include:\n\nChainRulesCore.jl\nRecipesBase.jl\nArrayInterface.jl\nCommonSolve.jl\nSciMLBase.jl","category":"section"},{"location":"developers/design-principles/#Functions-should-either-attempt-to-be-non-allocating-and-reuse-caches,-or-treat-inputs-as-immutable","page":"Design Principles","title":"Functions should either attempt to be non-allocating and reuse caches, or treat inputs as immutable","text":"Mutating codes and non-mutating codes fall into different worlds.
